## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
 git clone <repository-url>
 cd quiz-app
 npm install
```

---

## Running the Application
To launch the application in development mode, execute:
```bash
npm start
```
Access the app via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Changes to the source code will auto-refresh the browser.

---

## Testing
Initiate the test runner with the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
This runs the application tests interactively. Detailed information can be found in the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

---

## Building for Production
Generate an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
The build artifacts will be output to the `build` directory. The files are minified and prepared for deployment.

---

## Deployment
The application can be deployed to popular platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

---

## Configuration
If deeper customization is needed, the following command ejects the build configuration:
```bash
npm run eject
```
**Note:** This is irreversible and shifts full responsibility to the developer.
